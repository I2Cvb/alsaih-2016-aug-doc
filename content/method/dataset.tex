\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

The datasets used in this study were acquired by the \gls{seri}, using CIRRUS TM (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) \gls{sdoct} device \cite{Chen2005}.
The datasets consist of 32 \gls{oct} volumes (16 \gls{dme} and 16 normal cases).
Each volume contains 128 B-scan with resolution of 512~$\times$~1024~\si{px}.
All \gls{sdoct} volumes are read and assessed by trained graders and identified as normal or \gls{dme} cases based on evaluation of retinal thickening, hard exudates, intraretinal cystoid space formation and subretinal fluid as presented in the table below.
Within the \gls{dme} dataset, a large number of lesions were selected to create a rather complete \gls{dme} dataset.
The volumes and sample numbers for each volume are presented below (Fig.\,\ref{fig:bbdd}):
